Introduction
============

Assimilator was built to enable automotion through REST API, using JSON objects for easy understanding. With Assimilator a developer can self-serve his/her access through the network, while also auditors can request information without the need of network engineers. This API wraps around all possible vendor Firewalls, let it be appliances, virtual machines or cloud ACL.

With Assimilator one can automatize Firewall rules easily, just by simply make an HTTP request one can add/remove/modify/view rules and routes.

Altough there are other repos and people working on Firewall automation, this is the only repo that serves an API. I'm currently working alone in this and that's why I released Assimilator under `MIT License`_, because I need other people to help with other Firewall brands and bug fixes.
